Hello world, glad you wandered in!

My name is Christian Vasquez. I’m a journalist covering security, information security, and technology.

I’ve been writing about the impact people and policy have on the safety of key systems like electricity, water, and other essential services since 2018. I track and report on weaknesses in software, ransomware gangs, activity from Beijing, Moscow, Tehran (and the U.S.), as well as other nation-states in addition to hacktivists trends.

My work is driven largely by the idea that, much like politics and law, the technologies that surround our day-to-day lives shape our limits and redefine our agency. I do not think that technology is inherently neutral and I have spent the majority of my life using open-source software almost exclusively. My bylines have appeared in CyberScoop, E&amp;E News, and POLITICO, among others through syndication.

All that being said, I’m a writer and tinkerer trying to make people a bit more secure through journalism and analysis. Look around and be sure to reach out!
